   Sketchup is an easy-to-use 3D architectural tool that can be used to design objects and buildings in 3D. 
   Some features that make it an ideal program is the ability to type in specific measurements for buildings and objects, 
   as well as important readily made objects to decorate your design with. 
   <p/>This is not a program that you can easily export into a format for others to explore and would require the downloading of Sketchup. 
   However, its tools made it an ideal program for architectural prototyping which could come in handy when designing exhibits.

   Blender is an extremely powerful and free tool for creating 3D graphics. 
   Blender has been used to make animated films, special effects, art, 3d printed models and even used in creating video games. 
   It is a great platform for modeling, animating, simulating and, in the context of this project, can be used to create very detailed and engaging objects for your virtual museum!

      <thead>
          <tr>
              <th>Pros</th>

                  <p>Can be used to make very intricate and detailed environments</p>
                  <p>Would be good for making objects that could be integrated into a museum on another platform.</p>
              </td>
              <td><p>This is a modeling and 3d design program so it is not great for making an environment that someone will interact with unless you make it into a somewhat video game format</p>
                  <p>Has a steep learning curve and can be complicated for beginners</p>
                  <p>People coming to see your museum and interact with it will either have to have blender or whatever program you export your blender files to such as unity, unreal etc. which not a lot of people have or they would have to download the museum.</p>
                  <p>Aren’t able to host other media types (ex. Videos, websites etc)</p>
              </td>
      </tbody>
  </table>

Overall - Would be great to make environments in very niche scenarios and also great for making individual objects but would not be great for a whole museum itself.

   Gather Town is a web-conferencing software where you and your team members are in a virtual room where you can interact with objects, 
   one another and even work collaboratively with others based on your location in the room. 
   It is styled as an 18 bit game where you can customize your character and explore the space you are in. 
   You can make custom rooms and invite your team to collaborate in a more engaging and fun way than a traditional zoom call.

Can link a google doc as an object), People can explore on their own time, Low strain on the computer. Very easy to run</p>

   With Hubs by Mozzella you can design/create a 3D space and then invite people online to join the space and interact with each other. 
   Completely browser-friendly, it is a great way to mimic the real-life experience of running into someone and having a conversation. 
   Although not the easiest user interface to figure out how to customize the room, it is super easy to meet with other people and interact with an already designed room. 
   

IRL Museums
Virtual museums
Both
Customizability great to conceptualize your exhibit in 3D before building


Can invite people into the place and interact with other users (movement, talking ect)
Can move around in the place, like in IRL
The user doesn’t need to install a new program to use (browser-friendly)
Free to use!
Can install in a discord server (easy collaboration and sharing) 
Can upload photos and videos 




To completely customize an object, (ie one that isn’t in the main shop) you  need a different program to design it
Not the friendliest of user interfaces, does take some time to understand how to use it
